We chose MongoDB as our core data store for a few reasons: First, we have a ton of collective MongoDB experience, but further, who doesn't want to create applications using a simple and wonderful JSON-style document structure; It's a developers dream. We've since added Elasticsearch with Kibana and Redis experts to our team to broaden our offering. 

We joined the Rackspace family in February 2013 because we love the team and the open cloud technology they've built.

Parse your documents

Extract data from your recurring documents - such as PDFs, Word docs and scanned image files. Users love parsing invoices, shipping documents, bank statements, HR forms, sales projections and many, many more. 

Send your data, to where it's most useful

Once that data is extracted, you can send your data to 100's of endpoints. That could be a direct download to Excel, CSV, JSON or XML, or integrate directly with apps such as Google Sheets, Salesforce, custom webhooks or using 3rd party favourites such as Zapier, Integromat and MS Power Automate, connect to 100's of other endpoints - the options are limitless!

Customize with Rules
Precise and simple. Take advantage of standard rules, created to recognize your most common document fields - such as date, invoice number or values within a table for example. If you need a more powerful solution, build on existing rules, or start a document 'parser' from scratch with an incredible suite of options.

They want to pay a professional to solve the problem for them, but software companies don't have people available. Historically, SaaS companies below $75m ARR let these users churn. Once they hit the $75m mark, they either add an internal professional services division, or a partner program. Internal services divisons aren't as popular anymore, because they cause conflicting interests within the company. Partner programs are a formal way to organize and incentivize freelancers and agencies to serve your users.

Now with Sixty's partner program as a service, there's no reason to hire a team to build a partner program. SaaS companies can add one virtually overnight – as simple as it is to setup Zendesk. We're not just for larger companies either – the only barrier to adding Sixty is users requesting paid help.

With Sixty connected, paid subscribers and retention increase.
