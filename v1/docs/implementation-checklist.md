## Phase 2: API Endpoints & Business Logic

### API Structure
- [ ] Create RESTful company endpoints
  - [ ] GET /api/companies

  - [ ] POST /api/companies/import
- [ ] Create question endpoints
  - [ ] GET /api/questions
  - [ ] GET /api/questions/:id
- [ ] Create research endpoints
  - [ ] POST /api/research
  - [ ] GET /api/research/status/:companyId

### Research Logic

  - [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Build answer extraction logic
  - [ ] Extract YES/NO answers
  - [ ] Extract names and entities
  - [ ] Identify evidence and confidence

### Qualification Logic
- [ ] Implement question dependency resolution
  - [ ] Track which questions can be answered
  - [ ] Order questions optimally
  - [ ] Detect circular dependencies
- [ ] Create qualification status tracking
  - [ ] Update status based on answers
  - [ ] Track progress through questions
  - [ ] Handle disqualification conditions

## Phase 3: User Interface Components

### Company Display
- [ ] Create company table component
  - [ ] Dynamic column generation
  - [ ] Sorting and filtering
  - [ ] Status indication
- [ ] Build company detail view
  - [ ] Show all profile information
  - [ ] Display research progress
  - [ ] Present research results

### Research Interface
- [ ] Implement research workflow UI
  - [ ] Question selection
  - [ ] Company selection
  - [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Build research results display
  - [ ] Show answer, evidence, confidence
  - [ ] Display historical research
  - [ ] Indicate dependencies between questions

### Data Import UI
- [ ] Create import interface
  - [ ] File selection
  - [ ] Progress indication
  - [ ] Error reporting
- [ ] Add data preview
  - [ ] Show sample of imported data
  - [ ] Allow field mapping configuration
  - [ ] Validate before import

## Phase 4: State Management & Integration

### State Management
- [ ] Implement client-side store
  - [ ] Create store with proper interfaces
  - [ ] Implement change tracking
  - [ ] Add subscription mechanism
- [ ] Build API data synchronization
  - [ ] Fetch data from API
  - [ ] Send updates to API
  - [ ] Handle offline/error cases

### Integration Points
- [ ] Connect UI components to data stores
  - [ ] Bind components to data
  - [ ] Update on data changes
  - [ ] Handle loading/error states
- [ ] Implement research flow controller
  - [ ] Manage question sequence
  - [ ] Handle user interactions
  - [ ] Process research results

### Final Testing
- [ ] Test complete research workflow
  - [ ] Import → Research → Results
  - [ ] Verify all features work together
  - [ ] Check error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
  - [ ] Work with different CSV formats
  - [ ] Support required features
  - [ ] Handle legacy data

## Database Preparation (Future)

### Database Schema
- [ ] Design SQL/NoSQL schema
  - [ ] Companies table/collection
  - [ ] Questions table/collection
  - [ ] Research results table/collection
