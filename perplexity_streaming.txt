Determining the exact number of stars in the universe is quite challenging, as it involves estimating both the number of galaxies and the average number of stars per galaxy. Let's break down the current understanding:

1. **Number of Galaxies**: Recent estimates suggest there are between 6 and 20 trillion galaxies in the observable universe[5]. However, some studies have proposed figures as high as about 2 trillion galaxies based on Hubble Space Telescope observations[1].

2. **Number of Stars per Galaxy**: The Milky Way, which is a relatively large galaxy, is estimated to contain around 400 billion stars[5]. However, not all galaxies are as large as the Milky Way, and some may contain fewer stars. On average, galaxies are thought to have about 100 million stars, though larger ones like the Milky Way have many more[1].

3. **Total Number of Stars**: Estimates vary widely. A simplistic and somewhat outdated calculation might suggest there are around 1 septillion stars (1 followed by 24 zeros) if we assume there are about 10 trillion galaxies and an average of 100 billion stars per galaxy (similar to the Milky Way)[1]. However, more refined calculations suggest there could be fewer stars overall. For example, some estimates propose around 200 sextillion stars, but this seems to overestimate based on more recent discussions[4][5].

4. **Current Estimates and Adjustments**: Adjusting for the fact that not all galaxies are as large as the Milky Way and considering stellar death, recent estimates propose a lower number. For instance, the universe today might contain about 2.14 sextillion stars[5].

In summary, while estimates range widely, the most conservative and updated discussions suggest there are around 2.14 sextillion stars in the universe, taking into account variations in galaxy size and star formation over time. However, this figure remains speculative and subject to further research and refinement.
