QAD® companies processing card payments benefit in three significant areas from Credit Card Integration plus Enhanced Compliance (CCI+EC).

Get A Free Demo
Achieve key improvements with CCI+EC
Improve Bottom Line
Lower your total payment processing costs in multiple ways, along with reliable, economical processing from authorization through settlement. We assure lowest cost on every transaction and negotiate significantly discounted processor fees on your behalf. Increase revenue with our merchant statement analysis and by getting every eligible Level 2 & 3 discount, automatically.
Start Saving
Good Governance
Strengthen security for sensitive credit card data. Limit your risk and liability. Meet your obligation to your bank, ESG and SEC expectations for compliance. Check off 345 of the 366 questions you have to answer for PCI compliance, leaving only 21 straightforward answers, with support from ProStar. Through our exclusive partnership with Bright Lion, any QAD company can get ongoing PCI DSS compliance as a service.
Reach Compliance
Efficient Operations
Streamline your internal workload and eliminate manual credit card processing. Integrate credit card processing directly into the QAD transactions. Reduce work for your technical teams. CCI+EC processes credit card orders securely and efficiently for every version of QAD and all UIs. Exceed your customers’ expectations and improve your cash management with better timing - payments taking moments instead of days.
Get Integrated
Need to modernize payment functions?
For many manufacturing and distribution companies sales that require a credit card transaction are high cost and inefficient to manage, yet more and more customers expect this payment option. With CCI+EC, revenue from credit card sales is less expensive and time consuming than traditional PO based sales, not more.
The Only Full-Service A/R Solution for QAD
CCI+EC processes credit, debit, & virtual cards, ecommerce, and ACH orders for any version of QAD, with no changes to source code or the production database. The complete payment processing application provides fully-integrated functionality, data elements, business logic and screen adaptations for the credit card cycle.
A Few Example Functions:
An automatic buffer in the amount authorized to allow for freight, taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
Receipt of the on-line authorization number or reason for decline during Sales Order entry.
Integration with credit card hold data and logic.
A screen for manual entry of the credit card authorization number.
Logic to synchronize order variations with the processing provider.
Automatic online settlement, upon invoicing, for the actual invoice amount, including any adjustments and surcharges.
Reports for tracking authorizations and settlement activity.

Don't waste any more time, just get paid!

QAD & Progress Modernization
From just two applications of TailorPro, our projected one year total cost avoidance is over $63,000.
- Atlantis Plastics
Do Your Business Systems Really Meet Your Business Needs?
Our customers say “Yes!” They use TailorPro® to achieve the new and changing functionality in their systems that their business requires. The benefits of TailoPro are significant and long-term: cost savings, improved internal control and added value as your own systems better serve your business needs.
TailorPro Makes Your System More Effective
Adaptation possibilities are unlimited. Use the tools to insert or capture critical information in a process. Validate the sales order details based on unique business rules. Generate a warning or error when an inventory transfer violates an internal policy. Display training information the first three times a user executes a transaction. Our development tools have been used worldwide with resounding success for adapting QAD® and other Progress Software® (Progress) applications to meet customers’ unique business needs.
Get Integration Insight
TailorPro has proven versatility for resolving business needs. We love the challenge of new ways to apply it to new systems. Let us show you how easy it can be to integrate your unique business requirements into the natural flow of your business systems. Request a demo to find out how TailorPro can meet your business needs.
Progress Users: As there are many varied Progress applications, we suggest that interested Progress users simply
request a demo
.
QAD users: Read more below about the value of achieving a better fit between your business system and your enterprise requirements with the implementation of TailorPro.
About TailorPro
“Our experience with ProStar has been excellent...listened to the needs from not only a software perspective, but a business perspective and helped us design what we needed to do to make it work for us."
- Argon Medical
TailorPro® lets your business define your system software, not the other way around.
You know your business is unique. We know your system software must adapt to the unique behaviors that support your business. Unfortunately, most software systems are designed the other way around – in order to fit your work to their design, they limit the processes and functions of how your business can be organized. If you wanted to use QAD®, you had to do it the QAD way. Not anymore.
TailorPro adapts QAD and other Progress applications to your unique and changing business requirements, with no changes to QAD source code, with the cost-effective Developers' Toolkit. Get expert advice for systems integration.
Non-Invasive Customizations
The more accurately your business system matches your business processes, the more effectively everyone can use the system to achieve critical objectives. Every business performs standard tasks in slightly different ways, from order entry to pricing to shipping. Also adding to the challenge, these unique procedures change over time. No standard package can meet every customer’s needs - you need a customized system.
Prior methods:
Required intrusive modifications to the core application software and database.
Expensive to perform the first time.
Force “version lock” and hinder application of service packs and upgrades.
Must be re-done even to apply a software patch.
Not anymore!
With TailorPro, you are now able to enhance and adapt an application to match existing processes without creating invasive and costly customizations.
TailorPro enables you to handle your changing business needs on an ongoing basis by modifying the screens, business rules and data structures of the application; without any modification to source code or to the production database. Changes using TailorPro can be done in-house or by our Services team in a way that is both efficient and cost effective.
Get what you need.
TailorPro is more than an incremental improvement in methodology. With our adaptation engine the process shifts from “What will IT let us do?” to “What makes business sense for us to do?”
With TailorPro you really can have Your System, Your Way.
Want to see it work for you? We love to give demos of solutions in action! Challenge us to show you how TailorPro is relevant for your business:

QAD Solutions
Is your QAD® as effective as possible? The majority of TailorPro® customers use our tools in a QAD environment, successfully using standard “vanilla” QAD applications to adapt to their business’s unique and changing requirements. Every QAD customer can benefit from the solutions to this technology:
see what our customers have to say
.
TailorPro works seamlessly with all of the QAD versions and user interfaces, including SE and EE, from ChUI and GUI to Desktop and .Net UI.
You make the rules.
TailorPro’s context-sensitive implementation allows various behaviors to be turned on or off based on your specific needs. These adaptations include support for the user’s language requirements. Any language supported by Progress can be used within TailorPro.
Common TailorPro adaptations that leverage standard QAD more effectively:
Change surcharges at time of shipment.
Integration of data from external systems to new processes.
Controls to implement business policies and procedures.
Insert or capture critical information in a process.
Validate sales order details based on unique business rules.
Generate a warning or error when an inventory transfer violates an internal policy.
Display training information the first time a user executes a transaction.
QAD support & upgrades
TailorPro’s non-invasive customizations do not hinder the application of patches, service packs, and upgrades. They reside entirely outside the QAD source code and database schema, and they can be easily and individually turned on and off while the upgrade is tested.
Our customers experience:
More clarity and speed with support interactions.
Less anxiety and concern that a customization is at the root of a system problem.
The freedom of no longer being stranded on aging versions.
Get better at what matters®!
Join the TailorPro customers who are already adapting their standard QAD implementation to meet their business requirements and users’ needs.

Benefits of TailorPro
Rapid payback on investment in TailorPro with initial application. Further upgrades will not require changes to the TailorPro solutions. - NetShape Technologies
Do you want to maximize your IT budget? Of course you do. And we know it – any investment has to be justified in terms of what it delivers for the cost. Most software ROI (return on investment) is calculated in the 1½ to 3 year time frame. Our customers typically measure their ROI for TailorPro® in weeks to single digit months.
The initial costs for TailorPro are low, the development times are rapid, and delivery is straightforward. Learn what we can do for you.
Business benefits of TailorPro:
Get your unique business needs met.
Define your solutions away from, “What can IT do?”, into, “What makes business sense to do?”
Increase revenue with the adaptations themselves.
Save time and eliminate confusion with simplified business processes.
Improve compliance with enforced procedures throughout your organization.
Get easier management with standardized and validated data entry in the ways your company requires.
Improve customer interactions by making additional data available during transactions.
ROI is extremely efficient, most of our customers break even in 1-6 months. Get going right away with TailorPro today.
IT benefits of TailorPro:
Developers often deliver TailorPro adaptations in less than 25% of the time required by traditional customization methods. That’s what our customers tell us!
Simplified compliance with IT audit requirements; adaptations are self-documenting and context sensitive.
Easy patching and upgrading to new versions of QAD® and other Progress applications, because TailorPro doesn't require the discovery and re-implementation of complex or embedded customizations.
Save time with upgrades of applications like QAD, when done with TailorPro they take a fraction of the effort of upgrades done by means other than TailorPro.
Adaptations can be easily turned on and off, simplifying troubleshooting and vendor support. In our thirteen years of providing TailorPro, we have never had a failure of a TailorPro adaptation after testing and release to production.
Savings are at your doorstep.
The best benefit by far is that rather than struggle just to maintain customizations that are already deployed, all this frees up IT resources . With these additional resources, IT can better serve users and better meet your organization’s objectives. Find out today how your organization can profit from TailorPro.

Make the most of what we offer:
ProStar Software offers many consulting options with a great depth of Progress Software®, QAD®, and business systems integration expertise. We offer results-focused services that cost-effectively supplement your own organization.
If you run any combination of Oracle, SQL Server, . NET, Microsoft Sharepoint, Progress/OpenEdge applications, QAD, Salesforce.com, and other business applications:
– Resource Solutions, for companies needing systems integration expertise
In the modern, lean organization, any new project or business initiative can quickly put an IT organization beyond its capacity. Take advantage of our many Senior Consultants’ deep understanding of business systems integration and call on us to supplement your own staff when you need new complex functionality via TrackStar, TailorPro®, Credit Card Integration, or full systems integration with Mobile Enterprise Integration (MEI®).
Get a quote for Resource Solutions staffing.
If you run QAD:
- Tailored Solutions, best for smaller organizations with a few time-critical needs
TailorPro is offered with both a run-time license and a developers’ license. A company that purchases the run- time license can contract for Development Services, significantly reducing the need for training. Installation can be done remotely, and the SysAdmin/DBA can be trained via on-line meeting.
This option is ideal for a small organization that needs a handful of critical adaptations quickly. You can always purchase the developers’ license later and bring the development in-house. In the meantime, use Development Services from ProStar to supplement your own lean organization.

Installation can be done remotely, and the SysAdmin/DBA can be trained via on-line meeting.
This option is ideal for a small organization that needs a handful of critical adaptations quickly. You can always purchase the developers’ license later and bring the development in-house. In the meantime, use Development Services from ProStar to supplement your own lean organization.

Our world-class trainers adapt our standard TailorPro training to your specific application implementation. Training is typically done on-site, using your own development systems, your own data and your own business requirements. The classroom exercises are based almost entirely on adaptations you want to implement.
At the end of the training, you will have solutions to your specific issues ready to test, as well as a strong foundation in the TailorPro tools. Your staff will be fully capable in TailorPro and self-reliant in developing the solutions your business requires.

QAD & Progress Upgrades
Are you still on an old QAD® version?
We offer an easy process for QAD upgrades.  Move to a standard, modern version of QAD and still have your unique requirements met, using TailorPro and our services team, all for lower cost than you expect.
Our combination of technology and expertise provides:
Your required enhancements in any QAD UI
A standard, unchanged, upgraded QAD database and source code
Full TailorPro development licenses
Coordinated upgrade and development services
Reduced project costs
Reduced project time
Improved end state
Permanent freedom from version lock
Up-to-date and adaptable
During an upgrade past customizations must be found, evaluated, and likely redeveloped. Don't repeat the cycle that trapped you on an aging version in the first place. Move your customizations to TailorPro adaptations and never have to redevelop them again.
Because TailorPro adaptations have no impact on standard QAD, future upgrades take on average 50% less time and resources. Reduce the risk and cost of this and future upgrades, and still be able to upgrade whenever you need to.
Contact us to find out more. Upgrading can be simpler, more cost-effective, and more powerful than you imagined.

Philosophy
Work with purpose
ProStar Software exists under the philosophy of helping drive our customers forward with ease by efficiently integrating their business systems.
Here's a metaphor – think of all your business interactions and systems like a big city, you rarely have to travel all over the city, but you have a few normal spots you regularly travel to. You probably know or can figure out some way to get to a place outside your circle of expertise, but you don't automatically know how to optimize the best route. Our products and services are like having a subway, taxicab, gps or even a helicopter. We get you to your goal in the ways that best suit you, by providing technology and expertise that deliver.
Service
We feel it is a privilege to be of service. Our perspective is long-term! Thus we work diligently to grow and strengthen lasting, mutually beneficial relations with partners, resellers, and customers. We look forward to meeting the new and changing needs of our installed base and our new customers.
Continuous Improvement
Your feedback is always welcome. We very much appreciate participation in our process of continuous improvement. If you have noticed something is not working as it should be, including the website, or you have any questions, please use the form below to describe the issue. Or simply feel free to contact us directly.

Success Stories
How do our products and services benefit our customers? Here are some customer success stories in their own words:
NetShape Technologies, Inc (formerly Hawk Precision)
“NetShape Technologies is a global leader in the design and production of engineered components using advanced Powder Metallurgy (PM) and Metal Injection Molding (MIM) technologies.”
Paul Moser describes functionality:
“TailorPro® provides us with the ability to inject our business’s own requirements between the user and the source code.”
Paul's Challenge:
We needed a better fit between business needs and the business system.
Paul's Solution:
TailorPro provides the engine to enable the required customizations with no changes to source code or the production database. TailorPro is supporting our needs for SOX compliance with the Audit & Security bolt on.
Paul's Results:
Rapid payback on investment in TailorPro with initial application of Surcharges process. Further upgrades will not require changes to the TailorPro solutions.
Financial Analysis of Benefits in Yearly Savings or Value:
Time savings from Hot Key browses: $12K
Improved order fulfillment analysis: $50K
Surcharge collections & labor savings: $250K
Keeping CEO/CFO out of Sarbanes-Oxley Jail: Priceless
Superior Essex
Superior Essex is
“a Global Leader in the Design, Manufacture & Supply of WIRE and CABLE Products”
Benefits they receive from Credit Card Integration:
“Reduces steps to process a credit card order from 5 to 1. Provides additional payment options for our customers. Reduces accounts receivable balances. Reduces the time needed for an authorization from 30 minutes to 10 seconds. Improves the security of our customers’ credit card information.”
Argon Medical
Anita Young describes her company, and the services and support from ProStar:
“Argon Medical Devices is a world-wide manufacturer of medical devices used in heart surgeries, for interventional radiology, biopsies, etc. that has quadrupled in size during the last 3 years through acquisitions.
“Our experience with ProStar has been excellent. Cathi Peck trained and implemented our TailorPro. She listened to the needs from not only a software perspective, but a business perspective and helped us design what we needed to do to make it work for us. ProStar is committed to support and have worked with us any time there has been an issue to resolve those issues (even when the issue hasn’t been caused by ProStar, but affected our TailorPro application).”
Anita's Challenge:
“Due to medical device registrations in various countries, we needed the ability to allocate product with the same exact part number to the correct countries where it was registered. Due to the acquisitions, this product had different labels on it from different manufacturers, and was potentially made in different countries, although it kept the same item number.”
Anita's Solution:
“We used fields inside QAD® for the registrations of the items with the countries and labels. Then ProStar helped us write the program for the allocation with the business logic necessary to send the right product to the right country.” Anita's Results: “The solution was simple and elegant. Our ROI was less than 1 month.”
Vention Medical
“Vention Medical provides an integrated services solution for the design, engineering and manufacturing of complex medical devices and components. Our different facilities produce medical device sub-assemblies and components.”
Anant Gohil shares his company's experiences with ProStar:
“Implementation was good with detailed documentation and enough heads-up to prepare anything we needed to do internally. Support we have received has been excellent.”
Anant's Challenge:
“Within Medical environment, there are different instances wherein we require business users to follow certain procedures and processes while producing the products within our Systems – especially our QAD ERP application. High risk and high impact categories like labeling can cause major problem with the product end user, if those are not accurate.”
Anant's Solution:
“It became quite obvious that we needed to invest in a solution rather than risk any major recalls. Hence it became important for us to put business rules within ERP application using TailorPro solutions.”
Anant's Results:
“It has been very well received. Users can’t wait to incorporate more and more of such business rules and policies within the ERP application using TailorPro solutions. Our ROI estimate is 6 months.”
Atlantis Plastics
“Professional plastic extrusion and fabrication services. We specialize in the development of tubing and various other products.”
Cafer Barutcuzade goes on to explain two applications of TailorPro:
Cafer's Business Problem:
“Each Customer Service Representative has to take the unit of measure from the customer order and manually convert it to our manufacturing unit. This process has caused many errors and customer returns because it is dependent on several factors.”
Cafer's Solution:
“We used TailorPro to show a selection list of UM conversions within Sales Order Maintenance.”
Cafer's Results:
“Projected one year cost avoidance is over $38,000.”
Cafer's Business Need:
“Different sites have different offset days for Sales Order order date vs. due date.”
Cafer's Solution:
“In eB2 the due date defaults to order date. We put in a TailorPro solution to add a context sensitive number of offset days by site to the order date to come up with a due date.”
Cafer's Results:
"The annual labor saved is 1256 hours at $20 per hour or a savings over $25,000.”

QAD Enterprise Applications
What is Enterprise Resource Planning?
QAD and ProStar know that all businesses deal with common organizational needs, as well as facing a variety of challenges specific to their individual industry. Keeping up with consumers’ shifting buying habits has dramatically altered ways of forecasting demand and managing sales. Imagine you had a way to oversee and manage all of your business operations, addressing potential problems before they arise. That oversight ability is what makes Enterprise Resource Planning the best solution to address challenges like these and others, whether you're in the food and beverage, automotive, industrial, or technological industry.
Is ERP Right For You?
The following are key processes provided by QAD specifically to help successfully address enterprise challenges:
QAD DSCP (Demand and Supply Chain Planning)
QAD Trade Activity Management
Lot Trace Workbench
QAD QMS (Quality Management System)
Crop Level Serialization
Planning and Scheduling Workbenches
QAD Supplier Portal
Supplier Management
QAD Warehousing
QAD Enterprise Asset Management
QAD TMS (Transportation Management System)
ERP and Compliance
Government regulations have always been stringent and every country has its own laws. In the United States and Canada, laws vary by province and state in terms of what products can be distributed and how. Regulations for product traceability and labeling documentation demand careful management by manufacturers to comply. Cloud ERP and related QAD capabilities help businesses that require this type of Enterprise Resource Planning address the challenges unique to their sector. The solution developed at QAD is based on best-in-class, industry-specific business processes in order to provide you with the capabilities to meet regulatory requirements.
For more information on how the Enterprise Resource Planning solution can help your company, contact QAD or email

Disclaimer Of Warranty; Limitation Of Liability
The information contained within this website is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute accounting, tax, legal or financial advice.
You understand that you use this Site and the information, forums, and tools at your own risk and we do not guarantee that the information provided on the Site will be accurate or updated. We do not guarantee that we will continue to provide the Site, that the Site will be available at any particular time or from any particular place, or that it will continue to function in the manner that it currently functions. You agree not to hold us liable for damages you claim are caused by third parties who contact you using the Site or become aware of your identity through the use of the Site, and you understand that, while such behavior is a violation of this Agreement, we need not attempt to control or identify individuals who falsify their identities or provide false information to others through the use of the Site. You agree that we are not liable for the infringing, defamatory, offensive, or illegal contact of third parties, including other users.
IN NO EVENT WILL WE, OUR PARENTS OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF OUR RESPECTIVE INVESTORS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “INDEMNIFIED PARTIES”), BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING ANY INFORMATION, TOOLS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ADVERTISED IN, OBTAINED ON OR PROVIDED THROUGH THE SITE OR CONTENT CREATED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE).
THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, COMMUNICATION LINE FAILURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS BEHAVIOR, NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, EVEN IF THE CLAIM ALLEGES THAT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES’ CONDUCT WAS WILLFUL.
Governing Law; Integration; No Waiver; Severability; Termination
You agree that any dispute between you and us will be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of California, without regard to choice of law rules, and that any legal action brought by one party against the other will be brought exclusively in the appropriate court within the State of California. If you are located outside of the United States of America, you agree that, by entering into this agreement, you voluntarily subject yourself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America and the State of California, and you agree that you may be sued in those courts and subject to the judgments and orders of those courts.
You agree that, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if you are located outside of the United States, we may satisfy our obligation to serve you with legal process by sending an electronic mail message to the email address that you provided when you registered for the Services or by sending a paper communication to you at the postal address that you provided when you registered for the Services. You further agree that service will be deemed accomplished when we send the electronic mail message or paper communication, as appropriate, and that service may be proven through evidence that we sent the communication, regardless of whether we obtain evidence that you received the communication or that the communication was not delivered.
This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy incorporated within it, constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. They govern your use of the Site (but excluding services, if any, that we may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and us in relation to the Site.
Even if we act in a way that you believe to be inconsistent with this Agreement, those actions will not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of this Agreement. Similarly, our failure to object to your breach of your obligations under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.
If any provision of this Agreement is ruled unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be severed from this Agreement, and the other provisions will remain effective and enforceable. In addition, the severed provision will be deemed replaced with a comparable provision that most closely reflects the intent of the parties.
We reserve the right to terminate the Site and this User Agreement at any time without notice for any reason, including, in the case of the User Agreement, for your violation of any of its provisions. The Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability and Governing Law sections of this User Agreement shall survive any such termination.

Your use of such sites is entirely at your own risk.
You should be aware that third-party websites are not covered by this Agreement or our Privacy Policy, and we therefore cannot be responsible for the content or practices of any such website, even if it links to the Site or even if the website is operated by a company affiliated or otherwise connected with us.
