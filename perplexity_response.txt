Content: Estimates of the number of stars in the universe vary widely due to the vast scale and observational limits, but here are the most informed approximations:

- The observable universe contains roughly 2 trillion galaxies, based on deep-field images from the Hubble Space Telescope[1].
- The Milky Way, a fairly large galaxy, contains about 100 billion (100 thousand million) stars[2].
- Multiplying these numbers naively (100 billion stars × 2 trillion galaxies) gives about 1 septillion stars (1 followed by 24 zeros). This is a commonly cited estimate, but it is now considered an overestimate because:
  - Many galaxies are smaller and have fewer stars than the Milky Way.
  - Not all stars are visible due to observational limits.
  - Star formation rates vary over cosmic time and stellar lifespans affect counts[1][5].
- More refined calculations suggest there are approximately 2 sextillion stars (2 × 10^21) in the observable universe today, which is hundreds of times less than the naive multiplication estimate[5].
- Another popular figure often quoted is about 200 sextillion stars (2 × 10^23), but this is likely on the high side and less consistent with the latest research[4].

In summary, the best current scientific estimate for the number of stars in the observable universe is around 2 sextillion stars (a 2 followed by 21 zeros), acknowledging significant uncertainties and ongoing refinement in astronomical measurements and models[5][1][3].

Thus, while it is impossible to count precisely, the number of stars in the observable universe is on the order of a few sextillion stars.
